# NOTE: This is a service for the runit init system!  If you are using
#       something else (openrc, sysvinit, systemd, ...) then you do not
#       need to use this file.
#
# How to use this service:
#
# 1. Place this file in the `/etc/sv/kmonad' directory.  You will need
#    to create this directory; this is most easily done with `xmksv'
#    from the `xtools' package:
#
#      xmksv kmonad
#
# 2. Symlink to `/var/service':
#
#      ln -s /etc/sv/kmonad /var/service
#
# Note that any X11-specific functionality has to be placed in an
# appropriate place (e.g. `~/.xinitrc'), as the service will execute
# _before_ the X server is started.
#
# Note 2: xmksv can create by default a `down` file that disable
# kmonad to startup with system, if that happens just delete this file;
# see [2] for further details.
#
# The paths below should be absolute paths.  You can put environment
# variables in a `conf' file that's in the same directory as this file
# and refer to them here if you want; see [1] for further details.
