KMonad is implemented as an engine that is capable of running 'MonadK' actions.
The logic of various different buttons and keyboard operations are expressed in
this 'MonadK'. This module defines the basic types and operations that make up
'MonadK'. The implementation of how KMonad implements 'MonadK' can be found in
the "KMonad.App" module.

NOTE: All of this is a bit muddled, and redoing the way hooks are handled, and
the basic structuring of MonadK and MonadKIO are liable to change soon.

-- $keyfun

-- | Boolean isomorph signalling whether an event should be caught or not.
data Catch = Catch | NoCatch deriving (Show, Eq)

instance Semigroup Catch where
  NoCatch <> NoCatch = NoCatch
  _       <> _       = Catch

instance Monoid Catch where
  mempty = NoCatch

-- | The packet used to trigger a KeyFun, containing info about the event and
-- how long since the Hook was registered.

  , _event   :: KeyEvent     -- ^ The key event triggering this call
  }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- $hook
--
-- The general structure of the 'Hook' record, that defines the most general way
-- of registering a 'KeyEvent' function.

-- | ADT signalling where to install a hook
data HookLocation
  = InputHook  -- ^ Install the hook immediately after receiving a 'KeyEvent'
  | OutputHook -- ^ Install the hook just before emitting a 'KeyEvent'
  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- | A 'Timeout' value describes how long to wait and what to do upon timeout
data Timeout m = Timeout
  { _delay  :: Milliseconds -- ^ Delay before timeout action is triggered
  , _action :: m ()         -- ^ Action to perform upon timeout
  }

-- | The content for 1 key hook
data Hook m = Hook

  , _keyH     :: Trigger -> m Catch -- ^ The function to call on the next 'KeyEvent'
  }

-- $lop
--
-- Operations that manipulate the layer-stack

-- | 'LayerOp' describes all the different layer-manipulations that KMonad
-- supports.
data LayerOp

  | PopLayer     LayerTag -- ^ Remove the first occurence of a layer
  | SetBaseLayer LayerTag -- ^ Change the base-layer

-- $monadk
--
-- The fundamental components that make up any 'KMonad.Model.Button.Button' operation.

-- | 'MonadK' contains all the operations used to constitute button actions. It
-- encapsulates all the side-effects required to get everything running.

  emit       :: KeyEvent -> m ()

  register   :: HookLocation -> Hook m -> m ()
  -- | Run a layer-stack manipulation
  layerOp    :: LayerOp -> m ()
  -- | Insert an event in the input queue
  inject     :: KeyEvent -> m ()
  -- | Run a shell-command
  shellCmd   :: Text -> m ()

-- | 'MonadKIO' contains the additional bindings that get added when we are
-- currently processing a button.

  -- | Access the keycode to which the current button is bound
  myBinding  :: m Keycode
