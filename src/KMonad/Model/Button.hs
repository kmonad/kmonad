A button contains 2 actions, one to perform on press, and another to perform on
release. This module contains that definition, and some helper code that helps
combine buttons. It is here that most of the complicated` buttons are
implemented (like TapHold).

-- $but
--
-- This section contains the basic definition of KMonad's 'Button' datatype. A
-- 'Button' is essentially a collection of 2 different actions, 1 to perform on
-- 'Press' and another on 'Release'.

-- | A 'Button' consists of three 'MonadK' actions, one to take when a press is
-- registered from the OS, and another when a release is registered.
-- With a third when both should happen in sequence. This will only be used
-- by other button such as `tap-macro`.
-- Use 'mkButton' instead of this constructor.
data Button = Button
  { _pressAction   :: !Action -- ^ Action to take when pressed
  , _releaseAction :: !Action -- ^ Action to take when released
  , _tapAction     :: !Action -- ^ Action to take when tapped as a sub button
  }
makeClassy ''Button

-- | Create a 'Button' out of a press and release action
--
-- NOTE: Since 'AnyK' is an existentially qualified 'MonadK', the monadic
-- actions specified must be runnable by all implementations of 'MonadK', and
-- therefore can only rely on functionality from 'MonadK'. I.e. the actions must
-- be pure 'MonadK'.
mkButton :: AnyK () -> AnyK () -> Button
mkButton a b = mkButton' a b $ a *> b

-- | Create a 'Button' out of a press, release action and tap action
--
-- The non standard tap action is useful when inside other buttons
-- like `tap-macro`
mkButton' :: AnyK () -> AnyK () -> AnyK () -> Button
mkButton' a b c = Button (Action a) (Action b) (Action c)

-- | Create a new button with only a 'Press' action
onPress :: AnyK () -> Button
onPress p = mkButton p $ pure ()

onRelease :: AnyK () -> Button
onRelease = mkButton (pure ())

onTap :: AnyK () -> Button
onTap = mkButton' (pure ()) (pure ())

-- | Like 'onPress' but with an alternative button to use for tapping
onPress' :: Button -> AnyK () -> Button
onPress' (Button{_tapAction = Action t}) p = mkButton' p (pure ()) t

-- $running
--
-- Triggering the actions stored in a 'Button'.

-- | Perform both the press and release of a button immediately
tap :: MonadK m => Button -> m ()
tap b = runAction $ b^.tapAction

-- | Perform the press action of a Button and register its release callback.
--
-- This performs the action stored in the 'pressAction' field and registers a
-- callback that will trigger the 'releaseAction' when the release is detected.

-- it's before any of our own release, so holding is irrelevant.

-- $simple
--
-- A collection of simple buttons. These are basically almost direct wrappings
-- around 'MonadK' functionality.

-- | A button that emits a Press of a keycode when pressed, and a release when
-- released.
emitB :: Keycode -> Button

  (emit $ mkPress c)
  (emit $ mkRelease c)

-- | A button that emits only a Press of a keycode.
pressOnly :: Keycode -> Button
pressOnly c = onPress $ emit $ mkPress c

-- | A button that emits only a Release of a keycode.
releaseOnly :: Keycode -> Button
releaseOnly c = onPress $ emit $ mkRelease c

-- | Create a new button that first presses a 'Keycode' before running an inner
-- button, releasing the 'Keycode' again after the inner 'Button' is released.
modded ::
     Keycode -- ^ The 'Keycode' to `wrap around` the inner button
  -> Button  -- ^ The button to nest inside `being modded`
  -> Button

-- | Create a button that toggles a layer on and off
layerToggle :: LayerTag -> Button
layerToggle t = mkButton'
  (layerOp $ PushLayer t)
  (layerOp $ PopLayer  t)
  (pure ())

-- | Create a button that switches the base-layer on a press
layerSwitch :: LayerTag -> Button
layerSwitch t = onPress (layerOp $ SetBaseLayer t)

-- | Create a button that adds a layer on a press
layerAdd :: LayerTag -> Button
layerAdd t = onPress (layerOp $ PushLayer t)

-- | Create a button that removes the top instance of a layer on a press
layerRem :: LayerTag -> Button
layerRem t = onPress (layerOp $ PopLayer t)

-- | Create a button that does nothing (but captures the input)
pass :: Button
pass = onPress $ pure ()

-- release

-- $combinators
--
-- Functions that take 'Button's and combine them to form new 'Button's.
